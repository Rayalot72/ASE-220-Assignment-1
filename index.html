<p>I'm interested in programming as a career.  In my leisure time I'm interested in philosophy, mainly metaphysics and areas that intersect with it, and I play a fair number of videogames.</p>

<p>I prefer indie games to games made by big publishers, much of the gaming industry feels as if it's sold its soul otherwise.  I get the sense that a lot of people struggle with that aspect of the media they consume.</p>
